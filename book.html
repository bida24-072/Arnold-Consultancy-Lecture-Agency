Hypothesis-Driven Approach: Start with a hypothesis about the solution and test it with data. This saves time and keeps the focus on actionable insights.

80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle): Focus on the 20% of factors that drive 80% of the results. Prioritize high-impact areas to deliver quick wins for your clients.
